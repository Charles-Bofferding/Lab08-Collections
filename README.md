# Library Collections

This lab creates a few seperate collections. These can be used to store book objects and display them when requested. 
One collection is the Library which houses the books in a dictionary.
The other collection is the Bag which holds books in a list collection.

# Actions

Users can add books to the library, view the books stored in the library, check out book from the library to their backpack,
view the books in their backpack, and iterate through the collections.

These actions will be implemented through console command line prompts which will request simple typed inputs.
